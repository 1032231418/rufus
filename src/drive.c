 * Open a drive or volume with optional write and lock access
 * Returns INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE (/!\ which is DIFFERENT from NULL /!\) on failure.
 * This call is quite risky (left unchecked, inadvertently passing 0 as index would
 * return a handle to C:, which we might then proceed to unknowingly repartition!),
 * so we apply the following mitigation factors:
 * - Valid indexes must belong to a specific range [DRIVE_INDEX_MIN; DRIVE_INDEX_MAX]
 * - When opening for write access, we lock the volume. If that fails, which would
 *   typically be the case on C:\ or any other drive in use, we report failure
 * - We report the full path of any drive that was successfully opened for write acces
