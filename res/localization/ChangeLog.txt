This file lists any change that has been applied to the en-US translation of
rufus.loc since its original version. Translators are expected to keep their
translations up to date by monitoring this file on regular basis and applying
the same changes.

!!IMPORTANT!! The changes below only tell you WHERE you need to look in the
English version, to find what has changed. But it may not give you the complete
details of the changes, especially if a message spans multiple lines.
PLEASE do not just look at this Changelog when updating your translation, but
make sure you also look at the English translation. For instance, MSG_114, that
was introduced in v1.0.8 is MORE than one line!

Remember to also update the version number for your translation ('v x.y.z')
once you have matched all the changes that occurred for the en-US translation.
