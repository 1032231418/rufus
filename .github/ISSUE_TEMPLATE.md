Report checklist
----------------

(Place an x into each [ ] to confirm that you have read and performed the following)

- [ ] I had a look at https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/wiki/FAQ to see if my issue/question has been answered there.
- [ ] I performed a search in the issue tracker for similar issues, using keywords relevant to my problem.
- [ ] I clicked on the 'Log' button in Rufus and I have copied it, into the line that says `<FULL LOG>` below.
- [ ] The log I am copying is the FULL log, starting with the line `Rufus version: x.y.z` - I have NOT removed any part of it.

Additionally (if applicable):
- [ ] I have run a bad blocks check, by clicking the "bad blocks" check box in Rufus, and confirmed that my USB is not defective
- [ ] I have also tried one or more of the following:
  - [ ] Using a different USB drive
  - [ ] Plugging the USB into a different port
  - [ ] Running Rufus on a different computer
- [ ] If using an ISO image, I have clicked on the `#` button, at the bottom of Rufus, to compute the MD5, SHA1 and SHA256 checksums (which are therefore reported in the log I copied) and confirmed, by performing an internet search, that these values match the ones from the official image.
